## Indeed Location Search Extension

This is a firefox extension that adds a listing to the context menu (right click menu) when you click on a job listing on indeed.
You'll be able to search for the location and the company name + location on google maps.

I made this because I was tired of having to copy and paste the location into google maps every time I wanted to see where the job was located.
